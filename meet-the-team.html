            <p>As a budget advisor and completing my degree in Management and Finance, I realised how much families in Hamilton really struggles. I realised that people not only need help with finances but guidance on all aspects of their lives sometimes. To see that the help that is there only provides immediate relief but not helping fix the actual problems frustrated me. What excites me the most about our charity is the fact that we are really helping people. We don’t just put a band-aid on but we truly help families that needs it so desperately. We try and fix the problem not add to it.</p>
            <p>I recall the first food box we delivered. The family was about to have dinner {a loaf of bread with butter). When the kids saw this big box and opened it they started crying. The youngest one said to her mum, “Mum is this real food? We are going to have real food; we haven’t had real food in ages!!!”</p>
            <p>It was in that moment that I realised what a big difference our charity could make in people’s lives.</p>

            <p>Through my experience in the community through various roles and in different areas, I noticed a need to assist people and support them with the necessary skills to lift them out of poverty to a point where they are self-sufficient and can take care of their families.</p>
            <p>It is my goal to help those in need to get employment and stay employed rather than to provide a short term solution.</p>
            <p>I aim to assist them with education around finances and how to utilize their money wisely and responsibly.</p>
            <p>My aim for our charity is to get alongside the families we support in whatever their needs might be.  By doing this our charity is uplifting and restoring their self-worth by breaking down the barriers or obstacles which is withholding them from achieving their full potential.</p>
            <p>The greatest satisfaction that our charity gives me,  is to see the sparkle in the eye of someone who has been struggling for some time, and the smile on their face for the hope they have for a better future.</p>
